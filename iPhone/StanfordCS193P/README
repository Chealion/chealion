Chealion.git - Just a public git repository of various code snippets by Micheal Jones.
Everything here is available under an MIT License, but if you'd let me know where or how you used it I wouldn't mind. It's nice to know something I created isn't just languishing.

This is my public repository of my completed assignments of the CS193P class at Stanford. (http://cs193p.stanford.edu) These are made as I'm learning so they should not be taken as anything more than ideas for possible solutions.

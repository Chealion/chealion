Chealion.git - Just a public git repository of various code snippets by Micheal Jones.
Everything here is available under an MIT License, but if you'd let me know where or how you used it I wouldn't mind. It's nice to know something I created isn't just languishing.

------------------

AppleScripts
	CurrentPlayingTrack
		CurrentPlayingTrack.scpt
			Applescript takes the current playing track in iTunes and displays it using Growl. More a proof of concept than anything but plays nice with LaunchBar when I'm in the middle of a song.
	Signatures
		Signature Creating AppleScript - answer some AppleScript questions and fills out a pre-made HTML signature and installs for Mail or Thunderbird. See README found in folder for more details.
	TabCountGrowl
		tabcounttogrowl.scpt
			AppleScript to take the current number of open tabs in Safari and send it to Growl. Great for when I have more tabs open then I can count. (eg. the >> appears in Safari)

Dashboard
	logo.wdgt - A super simple widget with the express purpose of showing logo.jpg that will resize proportionally without any borders or anything similar.

Flickr
	flickrInfo.sh
		Shell Script to scrape a screen capture of your Flickr stats or a set to your computer. Requires webkit2png.
	<to be added: launchd plist>

LockedDVD
	openLockedDVD.scpt
		AppleScript to open and copy a locked DVD created by Sony DVD Recorders

Shell
	bashrc
		My .bashrc file - includes functions to show the top 5 memory "hogs" running along with a backup with date fuction (great for backing up configuration files)
	code2html.sh
		Shell Script to use enscript to create an HTML document of a piece of code.
	code2pdf.sh
		Shell Script to use enscript and ps2pdf to create a PDF of code. Was used to take code and convert it to a PDF so I could then print it on a printer at University. Requires Ghostscript to be installed as ps2pdf is not in the default Mac OS X installation.
	gitconfig
		My .gitconfig file
	gitignore
		My .gitignore file
	java.sh
		Shell Script to simplify jcr (Java Compile and run) of basic java applications.
	parentlock.sh
		Removes all .parentlock files from Camino, Firefox and any Thunderbird Profiles in ~/Library/ or ~/Library/Application Support
	passwordGen.py
		A simple password generator
	regex.py
		Simple python script to facilitate running regular expressions on the clipboard contents. My first Python script
	rumpusAddUser.py
		A python script designed to add a user to the User database for Rumpus and email the details (and generated password).
	whatIsOpen.sh
		Lists what files are open on external disks (helps let you know why they will not eject). Best used in conjunction with Platypus' Text Window

Web
	PHP
		BasicRedirect
			A super basic example of how to setup a page that requires a cookie to be present in order to view the site. This however does not redirect them back however as it's only present in index.php and is designed for use with Joomla.

WebKitNightly
	nightly.sh
		Shell Script that retrieves the latest version of WebKit and installs it. Kind of useless now that they've implemented Sparkle.

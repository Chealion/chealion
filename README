Chealion.git - Just a public git repository of various code snippets by Micheal Jones.
Everything here is available as Public Domain, but if you'd let me know where or how you used it I wouldn't mind. It's nice to know something I created isn't just languishing.

------------------

CodePrinting
	code2html.sh
		Shell Script to use enscript to create an HTML document of a piece of code.
	code2pdf.sh
		Shell Script to use enscript and ps2pdf to create a PDF of code. Was used to take code and convert it to a PDF so I could then print it on a printer at University. Requires Ghostscript to be installed as ps2pdf is not in the default Mac OS X installation.

Flickr
	flickrInfo.sh
		Shell Script to scrape a screen capture of your Flickr stats or a set to your computer. Requires webkit2png.
	<to be added: launchd plist>

LockedDVD
	openLockedDVD.scpt
		AppleScript to open and copy a locked DVD created by Sony DVD Recorders

Shell
	bashrc
		My .bashrc file - includes functions to show the top 5 memory "hogs" running along with a backup with date fuction (great for backing up configuration files)
	java.sh
		Shell Script to simplify jcr (Java Compile and run) of basic java applications.
	parentlock.sh
		Removes all .parentlock files from any Thunderbird Profiles in ~/Library/ or ~/Library/Application Support

AppleScripts
	TabCountGrowl
		tabcounttogrowl.scpt
			AppleScript to take the current number of open tabs in Safari and send it to Growl. Great for when I have more tabs open then I can count. (eg. the >> appears in Safari)
	CurrentPlayingTrack
		CurrentPlayingTrack.scpt
			Applescript takes the current playing track in iTunes and displays it using Growl. More a proof of concept than anything but plays nice with LaunchBar when I'm in the middle of a song.
		
WebKitNightly
	nightly.sh
		Shell Script that retrieves the latest version of WebKit and installs it.
